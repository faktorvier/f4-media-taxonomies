Add filters and bulk actions for attachment categories, tags and custom taxonomies.

== Description ==

F4 Media Taxonomies provides the ability to filter the media library by categories, tags and/or custom taxonomies.
You can use the built-in taxonomies (category or post_tag) or any custom taxonomy.

If a taxonomy is enabled for attachments, you can assign as many of their terms to an attachment as you need.
You can assign them directly in the media library or in every media-selector overlay.
There is also a nifty bulk function in the media library, which allows you to assign a single term to multiple attachments at once.

Attachments can then be filtered by these terms. The filters are available in the media library and in every media-selector overlay.

Different than other similar plugins, **F4 Media Taxonomies is 100% free!**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to enable categories =

The built-in taxonomy `category` can be enabled with this snippet. Just put it into your `functions.php`:

	add_action('init', function() {
		register_taxonomy_for_object_type('category', 'attachment');
	});

= How to enable tags =

The built-in taxonomy `post_tag` can be enabled with this snippet. Just put it into your `functions.php`:

	add_action('init', function() {
		register_taxonomy_for_object_type('post_tag', 'attachment');
	});

= How to enable custom taxonomies =

There are two ways to enable custom taxonomies for attachments:

**New taxonomy:**

If the taxonomy does not exist yet and you want to create a new one, you have to set the object_type in the `register_taxonomy()` function to `attachment` ([see WordPress codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy#Parameters)).

	add_action('init', function() {
		register_taxonomy(
			'media-category',
			'attachment'
		);
	});

**Existing taxonomy:**

If the taxonomy is already registered, you can assign it with this snippet. Just put it into your `functions.php` and change `media-category` to your taxonomy:

	add_action('init', function() {
		register_taxonomy_for_object_type('media-category', 'attachment');
	});

= The filters do not appear in the media overlay =

For a better performance, we only include the scripts and files when they are needed. Some plugins can cause a problem with this functionality.
For this case we offer a hook, which allows you to enable the filter for special conditions. If this hook returns `true`, the filter is enabled for the current site.

	add_filter('F4/MT/Core/has_filter', function() {
		return true;
	});

= Can I enable taxonomies directly in the backend? =

No. We simply use the taxonomies that are registered in the code. Maybe in the future, but we want to keep this plugin as lightweight and simple as possible.

= Is it really free? =

Yes, absolutely!
